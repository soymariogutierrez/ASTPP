 **Multi Tenant IP PBX (Private Branch Exchange)**
	 - PBX stands for Private Branch Exchange, which is a private telephone network used within a company or organization.
	 - The users of the PBX phone system can communicate internally (within their company) and externally (with the outside world), using different communication channels like Voice over IP, ISDN or analog. A PBX also allows you to have more phones than physical phone lines (PTSN) and allows free calls between users. 
	 - Additionally, it provides features like transfer calls, voicemail, call recording, interactive voice menus (IVRs) and call queues.
 
 **Purpose**
	 - Provide one single number that external callers can use to access all persons in a company.
	 - Allow the use of customized business greetings while answering calls.
	 - Place external callers on hold while waiting for a requested person to answer, and playing music or customized commercial messages for the caller waiting.
	 - Record voice messages for any extension from an external caller.
	 - Transfer calls between internal extensions.

	**How it will work**

 - This image gives us an idea of what a PBX system allows in terms of connectivity and reachability.

 - With a traditional PBX, you are typically constrained to a certain maximum number of outside telephone lines (trunks) and to a certain maximum number of internal telephone devices or extensions. Users of the PBX phone system (phones or extensions) share the outside lines for making external phone calls.

 - Switching to an IP PBX brings with it many benefits and opens up possibilities, allowing for almost unlimited growth in terms of extensions and trunks, and introducing more complex functions that are more costly and difficult to implement with a traditional PBX, such as:

 - Ring Groups
 - Queues
 - Conference
 - Voicemail
 - IVR
 - Feature Code
 - Pickup Call
 - Call Transfer.
 - Reporting and many more.
