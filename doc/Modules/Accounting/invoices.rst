**Manual Invoice** : Generate invoice button will create blank invoice (That means it will not consider any assigned services and CDR billing of account). Then admin will be able to add invoice items as per their need and submit it to customer. We consider this operation as manual invoice generation process. 

**Automatic Invoice** : System will generate automatic invoices and receipts for account from cron scripts. For Prepaid customer, system will generate receipt upon service assignment date and for Postpaid customer, it will generate invoice on defined billing date in account profile setting.

You can change invoice configuration from : http://astpp.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5/Modules/Configuration/invoice_configuration.html
