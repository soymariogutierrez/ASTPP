**DID Setting**

===========================  =================================================================
**Call Type**                DID-LOCAL : Wish to route call to Local extension

                             PSTN : Wish to route call to PSTN Number
                             
                             OTHER : If you wish to route call to custom destination
                             
                             SIP-DID : If you wish to route call to asterisk/other pbx server and if you need to use caller id in          header content then use this call type by setting one of the sip device of astpp which is registered as trunk on asterisk/other pbx server.
                             
                             DIRECT-IP : If you want to route call on same DID/Extension number which registered on other pbx server.
                             
                             DID@IP/URL : If you want to route call on other pbx


                             Multiple Destination : 

                             DID-Local and SIP-DID call-type can send calls to multiple destination simultaneously as well as one after another.

                             Example, If Destination string is '12345,78904' than system will try to send call to both destination simultaneously, whichever receives first call will be established with it.

                             If Destination string is '12345|78904' (with pipe sign) than system will try to send the call first to 12345 and if not received there than send the call to 78904.

                             You may also use comma and pipe sign together in string as per your usage.
                             
                             

**Destination**              Set appropriate destination based on call Type.

                             Example : 
                             
                             LOCAL : 1001 (Local Extension number)

                             PSTN : 1800214018 (PSTN number)

                             OTHER : sofia/default/1234567890@192.168.1.3

                             OR sofia/gateway/gwname/1234567890
                             
                             SIP-DID : 1234567890
                             
                             DIRECT-IP : xx.xxx.xx.xxx (server ip)
                             
                             DID@IP/URL : DIDnumber@xx.xxx.xx.xx
