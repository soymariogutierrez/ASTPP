This feature will write the SIP Devices information in FreeSwitch xml files. This will write files for only core ASTPP. If you have PBX add-on installed then you will need to work on the code to enhance it. 

How to configure and use: 
1. Copy folder in /opt/

2. Import sql file in database 
mysql -u <USERNAME> -p astpp < /opt/fs_custom/database/fs_custom.sql

Note: If you have more than 1 FreeSwitch servers then refer multiple_fs_custom.sql file and change triggers and tables accordingly. In this sql file, you will find the usage of 3 FreeSwitch servers.

3. Change paramters in directory.php file 
$fs_directory : Define path where you want to generate .xml files
$table_name : Define temp table name which you have created
$fs_cli_password : Give your freeswitch fs_cli password to reloadxml

Note: The default path of fs_cli is set to /usr/bin/fs_cli. If you do not have that then please create link to it and then execute the script.

4. Configure scripts in cron 
* * * * * cd /opt/fs_custom/ && php directory.php 

Additional: 
If you want to rewrite all the files then
cd /opt/fs_custom/ && php directory.php rewrite
